# Margrites Rules Summary

## Board
- 8 rows by 9 columns (matching the diagrams in the PDF).
- Rows are indexed 0 (Black’s home edge) through 7 (White’s home edge); columns 0-8.
- Setup zones: Black may place pieces on rows 0-1; White on rows 6-7.

## Pieces & Setup
- Each player controls eight identical pieces.
- Standard setup is simultaneous free placement within the first two home rows until both players approve opponent layouts (“gentleman’s game”).
- If players cannot agree, they alternate placing pieces until full deployment (“hostile game”).

## Turn Structure & Movement
- Black takes the first turn; turns alternate.
- Each turn grants exactly four moves, distributed across any pieces.
- Moves are one square, in any of the eight directions.
- A piece cannot revisit the square it occupied at the start of the turn.
- Two pieces may not occupy the same square.
- A move is illegal if the resulting position leaves that moving piece immediately captured (rule against martyrdom). Players must skip such moves; if every move is illegal, the turn is forfeited.

## Capture
- After every move, check adjacency (orthogonal or diagonal).
- A piece is captured and removed if opposing adjacent pieces outnumber allied adjacent pieces (including the threatened piece itself) by at least a 2:1 ratio.
- Captures resolve immediately and may cascade when pieces lose support mid-resolution.

## Scoring
- A piece scores by exiting the far edge of the opponent’s side (beyond row 8 for Black, beyond row 0 for White); scored pieces are removed and count as one point.
- Scored pieces cannot re-enter play.

## Endgame & Victory
- The game ends when a player has no pieces remaining on the board (all captured or scored) or resigns.
- Victory: highest score wins; if tied, the player with more captures wins.
